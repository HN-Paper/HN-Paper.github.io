                        A World Health Organization (WHO) team due to investigate the origins of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan has been denied entry to China.

                        Two members were already en route, with the WHO saying the problem was a lack of visa clearances.

                        However, China has challenged this, saying details of the visit, including dates, were still being arranged.

                        The long-awaited probe was agreed upon by Beijing after many months of negotiations with the WHO.

                            SINGAPORE — Indian drugmaker Cadila Healthcare is about to start a phase three clinical trial for a potential coronavirus vaccine, its chairman told CNBC.

                            “We’re now moving into phase three, which is going <!-- /zXk --> to start very, very soon,” Pankaj Patel told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Tuesday.

                            He said the trial will involve about 30,000 volunteers and will take about three to three-and-a-half months to complete.

                            The pharmaceutical company, which is also known as Zydus Cadila, said Sunday that it received approval from India’s drug regulator to begin the phase three clinical trial after earlier studies found its DNA vaccine candidate to be “safe, well tolerated and immunogenic.”

                            Soleimani died along with nine other people in a drone strike near Baghdad airport in Iraq in January.

                            A report by the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, says the US had not provided sufficient evidence of an imminent threat to life to justify the attack.

                            The US state department accused her of "giving a pass to terrorists".

                            Last week, Iran issued arrest warrants for US President Donald Trump and 35 others on charges of murder and terrorism in connection with the killing.

                        <p>
                            When we come across false information on social media, it is only natural to feel the need to call it out or argue with it. But my research suggests this might do more harm than good. It might seem counterintuitive, but the best way to react to fake news – and reduce its impact – may be to do nothing at all.

                        <p>
                                "5G at 60Ghz resonates with the oxygen molecule and gives oxygen a reverse polarity that makes it much less usable to the human body. At high concentrations of 5G usage you get suffocation of humans at street level. And at lower doses you get flu like symptoms which are the exact same symptoms as the flu with this lowered oxygen uptake by the body.
                                But the way 5G kills is much more interesting. Our bodies have trillions of parasitic organisms inside which feed on us and some say help us live by doing many useful functions. But when these bacteria, fungi, and parasites are subjected to any WIFI microwave radiations they are harmed and begin reproducing toxins in self defense. These organisms begin reproducing rapidly to ensure their survival. And so we get flu like symptoms from these internal parasite organisms under attack from WIFI microwave radiations reproducing rapidly and excreting toxins. <br>
                                Long story short, it can gives you Covid-19, cancer and make your wife leave you."

                        Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes.

                        Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread.

                        If it's not kept clean, your mask will be contaminated and will not work as well. It may put your more at risk of catching Covid-19.

                        In the UK, there are exemptions for children under 11, those with disabilities or certain health conditions such as respiratory or cognitive impairments that make it difficult for them to wear a face covering.

                        BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains the correct way to wear your homemade mask or face covering.

                            On 8 January, at 06:12 local time (02:42 GMT), UIA flight PS752 took off from Imam Khomeini International Airport. <br>

                            The plane was a Boeing 737-800 - one of the international airline industry's most widely used aircraft models. <br>
                            
                            Before it had left the airport's air space, the plane appeared to turn around to return to the runway. Shortly afterwards, it crashed.<br>

                            The aircraft's "black boxes", which record flight data and sound within the cockpit, were recovered from the wreckage.<br>

                            But there have also been reports that mechanical diggers were sent to the crash site before international investigators had arrived, prompting speculation that evidence was being destroyed.

                            SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico— A 5.4-magnitude earthquake <!-- /ik24dothtml --> hit near southern Puerto Rico on Saturday, briefly knocking out power and jolting many from their beds on an island where some people still remain in shelters from previous quakes earlier this year.

                Murder Hornets in the US

                Sightings of the Asian giant hornet have prompted fears that the vicious insect could establish itself in the United States and devastate bee populations.

                <p>
                    BLAINE, Wash. — In his decades of beekeeping, Ted McFall had never seen anything like it.

                    As he pulled his truck up to check on a group of hives near Custer, Wash., in November, he could spot from the window a mess of bee carcasses on the ground. 
                    As he looked closer, he saw a pile of dead members of the colony in front of a hive and more carnage inside — thousands and thousands of bees with their heads 
                    torn from their bodies and no sign of a culprit.
                    “I couldn’t wrap my head around what could have done that,” Mr. McFall said.
                    Only later did he come to suspect that the killer was what some researchers simply call the “murder hornet.”
                    With queens that can grow to two inches long, Asian giant hornets can use mandibles shaped like spiked shark fins to wipe out a honeybee hive in a matter of hours, 
                    decapitating the bees and flying away with the thoraxes to feed their young. For larger targets, the hornet’s potent venom and stinger 
                    — long enough to puncture a beekeeping suit — make for an excruciating combination that victims have likened to hot metal driving into their skin.
                    In Japan, the hornets kill up to 50 people a year. Now, for the first time, they have arrived in the United States.
                    Mr. McFall still is not certain that Asian giant hornets were responsible for the plunder of his hive. 
                    But two of the predatory insects were discovered last fall in the northwest corner of Washington State, a few miles north of his property — 
                    the first sightings in the United States.
                    Scientists have since embarked on a full-scale hunt for the hornets, worried that the invaders could decimate bee populations in the United States 
                    and establish such a deep presence that all hope for eradication could be lost.
